### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on AIGC matters at Deepsymph in Beijing, including FaceBeauty, FaceID, lightweight model, background generation, etc.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning multiple backend and methods in ComfyUI custom node, as well as model implementation. Also I'm interested in voice synthesis.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on ComfyUI related repo and Diffusion research.
- ðŸ˜„ I graduated from THU and dropout from CUHKSZ as a PhD precandidate. I was suffering from Bipolar disorder due to staying up late and lack of sun, yet I'm proud to say I've conquered 5-Hydroxytryptamine in my brain and feel satisfied of my rehabilitation.
- âš¡ I know some ABC of adversarial attack and ElecDesign works, I'm practicing Roland electric piano recently. I'm a big fun of boardgame and indie game.
